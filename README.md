This is a program I wrote fall 2012 to help me shop for groceries. It allows you to copy and paste in a
recipe, and attempts to parse the ingredients required. It stores each recipe in a text file. Then you can
view all recipes you have saved, and select which ones you wish to cook. The program will compile all the 
ingredients required for those recipes, and output a shopping list for you to your desktop.

I wrote all of the GUI elements myself, only using the PyGame module to actually draw to the screen.
