<h1 align="center">Welcome To The Grocery Spy Tutorial!</h1>
<br/>
First, Click "Start Here" to begin
<Br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\a  Home Screen.png">
<br />
This is the home screen for grocery Spy. Click "Browse All" to view the recipes currently in the database.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\b  Browse All.png">
<br />
Here we can see our recipes. We'll come back to this page in a minute. Click the back button in the top right, and then click "Add Recipe" <br />
to add a new recipe to the databse.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\c  Add Recipe.png">
<br />
Here you can add recipes to the database. Lets start by filling in the Ingredient List.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\e   Grab Recipe From Website.png">
<br />
Grocery Spy accepts copy and paste from the clip board. To add a recipe copy and paste each element of the recipe into the specified field. <br />
We will start with the ingredients.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\f   Sanitize Input.png">
<br/>
Because humans can write the same thing in many different ways, not all ingredient lists will be understood by Grocery Spy. For example, <br/>
ingredients written: # (amount) <unit type (i.e. can in this case)> <name of the ingredient>  will not work. If we rewrite these ingredients <br />
to take out the parenthesis, Grocery Spy will be able to understand the ingredient list. The spacing and other ingredients will be <br />
handled just fine.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\g   Paste Into Ingredient List.png">
<br />
After copying our cleaned up ingredient list, simply press control + v to paste it into the Grocery Spy window. Then click Add Entry
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\h  Add Recipe Pasted.png">
<br />
If all goes well, the field we just filled in will now have a check mark on it. Complete the other fields in the same way, just by copy <br />
and pasting. Don't worry about spacing or line breaks, Grocery Spy will automatically format your input. You can leave any field except <br />
the ingredient list blank, by simply hitting "add entry" without copy and pasting. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\i   Add Recipe All Pasted.png">
<br />
Once all fields have been entered, the "submit recipe" button will appear. Click here to add your recipe to the database.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\j  Browse All With New.png">
<br />
Return to the "browse all" page, and we can see our new recipe has been added.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="TutorialImages\k  Browse All With New Select.png">
<br />
Click the arrow button next to any recipe to view more information about that recipe.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\m   Browse All with New Expanded.png">
<br />
More information about our new Cuban Ropa Vieja recipe.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\n  Browse All With New Expanded Select.png">
<br />
Its difficult to view our recipe inside the Grocery Spy window. We can scroll up or down using the arrow keys, but it would be easier <br />
to have this all in its own window. Select the pen and paper icon to create .txt file on the desktop.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\n  desktop view.png">
<br />
A view of the desktop with the new recipe in text file form.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\o Text File View.png">
<br />
And this is what the text file looks like.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\p   Add To Cart Select.png">
<Br/>
Now for my original reason to create this program. I always find that I go to the grocery store, buy everything I think I need <br />
then when I get home I realize I forgot one thing, so I have to go back. Or I make 3 trips during the week, each time I only buy <br />
what I need for the one recipe I'm cooking that day. With Grocery Spy, this hassle can be avoided.<br/><br/>
Let's say I want to cook Cuban Ropa Vieja, Homemade Vegetable Soup and Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork this week. I can select the cart icon <br />
(which will switch to the check mark to show that the recipe has been added), as shown in the above picture.
<br/>
<br />
Return to the main menu using the back button in the top right, and then select "view cart." We can see all the ingredients we need to <br />
buy the recipes we have selected! No more forgetting one random thing, we now have it all on one list. Grocery Spy will add up matching <br />
ingredients, so if two recipes need a clove of garlic, it will combine them into 2 cloves of garlic as seen here. Also, if at any time <br />
you decide you don't want to cook a recipe after all, you can navigate back to the "browse all" screen and unselect it by clicking the <br />
cart button again. This will remove all ingredients for that recipe from your grocery list.<br />
When you are satisfied with your grocery list, click the pad and pen.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\r   Desktop View With Grocery List.png">
<br />
Back to the desktop, Grocery Spy has put our new grocery list into a .txt file for easy viewing and printing.
<Br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\rr  grocery list txt view.png">
<br />
And here is the text file
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialImages\s   Delete Recipes.png">
<br />
So lets say you our Cuban Ropa Vieja didn't taste so good. We can delete the recipe from our database by selecting the "delete recipe" <br />
button. Clicking the red X will make it turn blue, which deletes the recipe. Once we click the back button, all selected recipes will <Br />
be deleted.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="tutorialimages\z   Browse All After Deletion.png">
<Br />
And here is our new recipe list, with the deleted recipes removed<br/>
<br/>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

That's it! I hope Grocery Spy is useful to you! <br />
